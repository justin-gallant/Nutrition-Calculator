# My Personal Project - Dietary Tracker

## Phase 0 - Project Proposal:

### Proposal:

I want to propose a **Dietary Tracking Tool**. 
This can be used to track calories, protein, carbohydrates, and more. 
There will be multi-profile functionality so that a person can select which diet they follow
and set their goals accordingly.
There will also be the option for a different user to log in.

### User Story 1 - Basic Functionality:
- As a user, I want to be able to modify my goals and my progress
- As a user, I want to be able to select which macronutrients I want to track
- As a user, I want to be able to add or remove different nutritional profiles (diets) for my person
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to adjust the tracking period from daily to bi-weekly etc.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my previous tracking period's results

## Phase 1 - ...:
