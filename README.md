# My Personal Project - Dietary Calculator

## Phase 0 - Project Proposal:

### Proposal:

I want to propose a **Dietary Guiding Tool**. 
This can be used to help a person determine how many calories, protein, and carbohydrates they need.
Primary audience will be those who are active and into weightlifting.
There will be multi-diet functionality so that a person can select which diet they follow
and set their goals accordingly.

### User Story 1 - Basic Functionality:
- As a user, I want to be able to modify my goals
- As a user, I want to be able to add or remove different nutritional profiles for different goals (diets)
- As a user, I want the app to calculate the dietary requirements for my goal and show them to me
- As a user, I want to create a custom diet (for an advanced user)

## Phase 1 - ...:
